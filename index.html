              <div class="line">Better Call Saul, on which you&#x27;ve been working for over almost a decade now, is the only prominent TV series that puts notions of behavioural economics at the very forefront.</div>
            </div>
            

            <div class="turn speaker-gs">
              <div class="who" aria-hidden="true">GS</div>
              <div class="line">If nothing else, we did have an entire episode that gets its title from the behavioural economics literature, episode 303, Sunk Costs. In the last scene of this episode Kim Wexler decides to help Jimmy with his misconduct charge and when Jimmy wonders why, she says: “Let’s just call it the fallacy of sunk costs.”</div>
            </div>
            

            <div class="turn speaker-sh">
              <div class="who" aria-hidden="true">SH</div>
              <div class="line">The fallacy of sunk costs refers to situations where people throw good money after bad – where they keep investing into doomed projects to which they feel committed for irrational reasons.</div>
            </div>
            

            <div class="turn speaker-gs">
              <div class="who" aria-hidden="true">GS</div>
              <div class="line">Exactly.  We liked the layers of irony here, too—Kim knows what the fallacy is, and is aware of the risks she&#x27;s taking and yet she still takes the dive.  I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s irrational or counter-rational; is there a term for when you recognize an unconscious motivation in yourself and lean into it?  Like Macbeth being told his tragic future and racing towards it …</div>
            </div>
            

            <div class="turn speaker-sh">
              <div class="who" aria-hidden="true">SH</div>
              <div class="line">Oh, that raises multiple deep questions from where I am coming from. In strategic situations, “games”, as we call them, where your actions impact on other peoples’ rational calculus—it can be rational to engage in the seemingly irrational if that sways your counterpart&#x27;s behaviour in the desired direction. But that entails the idea here, if we want to resurrect Kim’s rationality, that she is foreseeing the future. Or at the very least, that she believes that her move might possibly alter the fundamentals.</div>
            </div>
            

            <div class="turn speaker-gs">
              <div class="who" aria-hidden="true">GS</div>
              <div class="line">I think she&#x27;s playing the odds.  She knows that she is making an investment into a very risky project but she wants to believe in it at this stage.  She wants to believe in Jimmy.  She wants the self-fulfilling prophecy.  Whether that&#x27;s rational or not, I don&#x27;t know.  Does the rationality of a decision in a game depend on the payoff?</div>
            </div>
            

            <div class="turn speaker-sh">
              <div class="who" aria-hidden="true">SH</div>
              <div class="line">Absolutely. The idea is that players maximize a weighted average of the possible payoffs, with the weights being determined by their expectations. Or, to put it differently, from an empirical stance, we would think that players’ actions reveal their underlying hidden payoffs. And when it comes to emotional things the payoffs can be huge, of course. So, you think that Kim thinks that she can sway Jimmy, because it’s after all a kind of a love story?</div>
            </div>
            

            <div class="turn speaker-gs">
              <div class="who" aria-hidden="true">GS</div>
              <div class="line">Hmm.  Yes and no, I&#x27;d say.  Sure, it’s a love story, but I think she knows that she might be making a mistake.  Still, she wants to believe that it will all be okay. Yet, she is aware that at some time in the future, then in retrospect, it might very much look like the sunk cost fallacy.  She has to gamble not that Jimmy can change—whether people truly change or their character is simply revealed is a major theme of both Better Call Saul and Breaking Bad—but that Jimmy is already the person she hopes he is.  .</div>
            </div>
            

            <div class="turn speaker-sh">
              <div class="who" aria-hidden="true">SH</div>
              <div class="line">There is branch of game theory analyzing so-called “psychological games” where the players’ payoff is directly influenced by their beliefs. Just holding a certain belief might make them happy or sad. And when there is evidence that forces them to update their beliefs because they are no longer in line with reality, this can cause depression or joy.</div>
            </div>
            

            <div class="turn speaker-gs">
              <div class="who" aria-hidden="true">GS</div>
              <div class="line">If I have learned anything in the last five years, it&#x27;s that belief is stronger than reality.  Seems like we really can only see reality through our beliefs—Althusser got that right, at least.  And Kim definitely gets something out of her sheer belief in Jimmy’s possible goodness and she just has to hope that their future is set and it comes out okay.</div>
            </div>
            

            <div class="turn speaker-sh">
              <div class="who" aria-hidden="true">SH</div>
              <div class="line">When you say “the future is set” there are two ways of reading this – as a denial of free will or a belief in some sort of equilibrium where things happen because of choice.</div>
            </div>
            

            <div class="turn speaker-gs">
              <div class="who" aria-hidden="true">GS</div>
              <div class="line">Well, the show embraces the idea of choice. It would be boring otherwise.  Drama is about seeing people make choices when the stakes are high, right?  But my understanding of &#x27;tragedy&#x27; is that it troubles that idea.  In tragedy, the future is set, and the characters struggle mightily against that fact, so all their choices are partial.  They&#x27;re phantasms; they look like choices until the end reveals there never was a choice at all.  But if you play that too hard, like I say: very, very boring.  Or deeply, absurdly depressing.  Samuel Beckett territory.</div>
            </div>
            

            <div class="turn speaker-sh">
              <div class="who" aria-hidden="true">SH</div>
              <div class="line">Yep, to view your life as a TV show that somebody else created wouldn’t be easy to bear. So let’s look ahead at an undetermined future. Of course, we agreed that you wouldn’t spoil anything and we have, at the time of our discussion, still the last season to go—</div>
            </div>
            

            <div class="turn speaker-gs">

              <div class="who" aria-hidden="true">SH</div>
              <div class="line">I certainly hope you do!  But at the end of season 4, when you came to the WZB and we started talking, Jimmy utters his “It’s all good man” phrase—the phrase which gives him his new name, Saul Goodman—as a moment signifying that Kim’s investment will go foul.</div>
            </div>
            

            <div class="turn speaker-gs">
              <div class="who" aria-hidden="true">GS</div>
              <div class="line">Since we talked in Berlin in 2019, season 5 also aired and I don&#x27;t think it made Kim&#x27;s bet on Jimmy look any better!  Although I might argue that Jimmy&#x27;s bet on Kim has never seemed stronger.  All that said, it doesn&#x27;t look good overall, no. Whether there&#x27;s any coming back from it, any redemption—for either of them... remains to be seen.</div>
            </div>
            

            <div class="turn speaker-sh">
              <div class="who" aria-hidden="true">SH</div>
              <div class="line">It’s good that you mention redemption. American movies like to offer it for their characters but not so the Breaking Bad universe which hasn’t been very generous in bestowing redemption on its protagonists so far.</div>
            </div>

              <div class="who" aria-hidden="true">SH</div>
              <div class="line">But is Jesse’s future in Alaska, that shines somewhat bright at the end of El Camino, proper redemption?</div>

            <div class="turn speaker-gs">
              <div class="who" aria-hidden="true">GS</div>
              <div class="line">It&#x27;s a good question.  Does suffering expiate sin?  Does doing good?  Repentance?  Recognition and profession of wrongdoing?  I don&#x27;t know.  I feel like Jesse suffered, and I think he certainly knows he did bad, but I&#x27;m not sure he is washed of his sins. But it looks like he is getting away without paying the ultimate price: he lives to fight another day.</div>
            </div>

            <div class="turn speaker-gs">
              <div class="who" aria-hidden="true">GS</div>
              <div class="line">That&#x27;s interesting!  Maybe I&#x27;m wrong, but I can&#x27;t think of any mention of heaven in this universe. But Walt does tell Jesse that they&#x27;re already doomed to hell for what they&#x27;ve done. So, there&#x27;s no metaphysics of reward, only of punishment.  It&#x27;s a moral universe where people understand evil but struggle to grasp goodness.  I think Jimmy especially is consumed by the wrong question about himself.  He&#x27;s so worried that he is bad, as an ontological condition, an ineluctable truth about himself—that he neglects to do good.  I think all these factors make redemption feel like a fever dream.  Or at least partial, temporal.  Earthly, like you say.  And if you can be redeemed on earth, you can also backslide into perdition; it&#x27;s not a permanent state of being.</div>

              <div class="line">If I think about Kim, I hope for her sake you have a better outcome in store for her. The internet is rife with speculations that you will ultimately have to kill her off – basically because she doesn’t appear in Breaking Bad.</div>

            <div class="turn speaker-gs">
              <div class="who" aria-hidden="true">GS</div>
              <div class="line">I, too, have heard those speculations!  And we love that people are so invested.  Of course, we try to remind fans she could have just left; she could have stayed and been just off screen the whole time; she could have been in prison!  There&#x27;s a whole world of possibilities, and death is a very narrow one.  And not always a dramatic one, either.  The dead are done with their conflicts.  I wonder if there&#x27;s some pull of nihilism in thinking that death is the only end that has a moral or emotional consequence.</div>
            </div>

              <div class="line">Oh, I completely blame the Romantic tradition—and the Wagnerian impulse is perhaps the summit here—that intertwines love and death.  And that makes death the best consummation for true lovers!  I feel like all the internet commentators who angrily tell us not to &quot;do anything&quot; to Kim secretly yearn to have Jimmy sing his Liebestod over her body, and break all our hearts together.</div>

And really, I think we all wish there was more wiggle room to see Kim in action, yet it feels like her story is bound up in Jimmy&#x27;s.  Then again Vince originally had the same impulse with Saul Goodman. This prequel turned out okay, I hope, so who knows?</div>

              <div class="who" aria-hidden="true">SH</div>
              <div class="line">The understatement of the year but let us get back to the role of behavioural economics, or more broadly, the role of deviations from rationality for story-telling. Aristotle demands in his Poetics a very strict form of consistency for the plot of a story – to quote: “… the structural union of the parts being such that, if any one of them is displaced or removed, the whole will be disjointed and disturbed.” To me this definition is very much in the same spirit as the definition of Nash equilibrium, which forms the foundation of modern game theory and economics – that every player must behave optimally given the actions of other players, because otherwise the “whole” will not make sense.</div>
            </div>
            

            <div class="turn speaker-gs">
              <div class="who" aria-hidden="true">GS</div>
              <div class="line">But aren’t you conflating plot consistency with individual rationality here? Nash equilibrium, as far as I understand, is about the implication of individual rationality for outcomes or plots, if you like, if everyone is rational and everyone knows that everyone is rational and everyone knows that everyone knows and so forth.</div>
            </div>
            

            <div class="turn speaker-sh">
              <div class="who" aria-hidden="true">SH</div>
              <div class="line">That is correct. It’s about the interplay of individual rationalities.</div>
            </div>
            

            <div class="turn speaker-gs">
              <div class="who" aria-hidden="true">GS</div>
              <div class="line">But then it strikes me that by equating Aristotle with Nash you demand more from plots than the Poetics.  In fact, that&#x27;s a conversation that is near-constant in the writers&#x27; room:  who knows what, how do they know it, and do the other characters know that they know.  It&#x27;s truly epistemological quicksand.  But when we start getting pulled in, usually the thing that pulls us out is to get out of the rational and go by &quot;feel&quot; as dramatists.  So, it becomes less a knowledge question than one about finding the compelling action that fits—leaning more on the Unity of Action, perhaps, than that of Time or Place in Aristotelian terms.</div>

              <div class="who" aria-hidden="true">SH</div>
              <div class="line">“Feel” is an interesting notion where I would argue that evolution has hammered consistency into us. So “feel” might just mirror a demand on rational consistency and when I look at all the dramatic work that survived over decades and centuries it strikes me that epistemological consistency is a real plus, if not a necessary condition.</div>

              <div class="line">True.  I often argue with people about whether lyrics matter in pop songs, because they&#x27;re only a small fragment of how the emotion is conveyed—and really, the smallest, least compelling part in my opinion.  The band Sigur Ros sings in a literally made-up language much of the time, but I find their songs deeply emotional.  And I could take the argument one step further, and put it in more general terms: sound changes perception. It can seduce in a way that&#x27;s distracting, subliminally or more directly.</div>

              <div class="line">Indeed. Our whole sound team is filled with magicians.  They weave these spells with soundwork that make you feel things as you watch, without necessarily knowing what&#x27;s carrying the emotion.  Dave&#x27;s music of course stands out in that regard, but he&#x27;s always careful to only score where we absolutely need it.  If a scene stands on its own—&quot;dry&quot; as we say, meaning without music—he&#x27;s the first to say we should play it dry.  And I think you can trust the music more in that regard.  It doesn&#x27;t only show up when we have to fudge our inconsistencies, as sometimes happens elsewhere.</div>

If he&#x27;s good for her now, does that mean he&#x27;s not having long-term ill effects?  And that she&#x27;s not having long-term ill-effects on him, for that matter.  There&#x27;s that strange give-and-take that happens when you&#x27;re in a relationship that almost makes the relationship its own, separate third party—and I might argue that one big question is what their relationship is doing to them both as separate entities.

But we also know that there are tolerances within the system to inconsistencies, which we can exploit for entertainment.  Or, as one of my bosses puts it, we have to navigate between two extremes:  confusion for the audience on one side, and boredom on the other.</div>

I&#x27;m put in mind of aleatory composers like Xenakis or Cage, who would use randomness to generate raw musical material, but then they would also shape it, using their human aesthetics—they&#x27;d bring some order to the chaos.  Even the most ambiguous narratives have some kind of structure—I&#x27;m thinking of Surrealism here, which seems to me about as far as you can go narratively without crossing over into pure abstraction. Or at least, where the structure is amorphous, there&#x27;s a visceral, emotional response that positions the audience in a certain way.  Good drama mines those productive ambiguities – to generate the possibility of suspense and surprise.</div>

My whole more academic engagement with TV shows goes back to my interaction with the late and great Sir Peter Jonas with whom we had Vince on stage at the WZB in 2013. Peter had been, no question, the world’s most important opera intendant and his mantra was that new productions of old operas had to be a form of, I quote, “rape”, that is they had to violate the author in some way to be justified. So, from my hermeneutic perspective, I would say, hey, what can you do. Once it’s out it’s no longer the author’s. If the author wants himself present, he has to do the Flann O’Brien move.</div>

Wouldn&#x27;t the character of the author be equally compromised as a representation?  Maybe even more so!  I for one am not sure I have the ability to present a version of myself that&#x27;s accurate—I&#x27;m not really convinced anyone does.  A character based on me, written by me, would be a copy of a copy of a copy of a version I tried to make for some specific reason ...</div>

              <div class="line">And whatever the latest copy, a German theatre director would somehow invert it. So, my take is, when it comes to interpretation, as viewers we can only try to interpret what we actually see/read/hear. Neither do we have to resort to the original (by saying but the author intended something else) nor do we have to do engage in the meta multiverses of possible alternative stagings. And when it comes down to it, I imagine the original works, the plays in writing, TV shows in their first incarnation, or other works surviving, while biographical details get lost. We have this situation with Homer or the architects of the Pyramids.</div>

              <div class="line">Ha!  You know, when you talk about the author and television—at least, American TV in most of the incarnations I know—that question of &quot;intent&quot; becomes so hard to pin down.  For example, I have a role as a writer in the room, pitching story ideas.  I have a role as a writer of the episode to take whatever the showrunners have landed on for the story and commit it to the page.  But then, that&#x27;s just one stage of the production—the director, producers, cinematographer... all the departments put their fingerprints on the final product.  And that&#x27;s not even including the actors!  Someone asked me once if the final image of episode 305 after Chuck&#x27;s breakdown on the stand was in the script, and I had a hard time answering that question.  Because the &quot;exit sign&quot; is absolutely called out there, but the composition of that shot—and how it lands in the cut—that&#x27;s the result of the work of Dan Sackheim, who directed, and Marshall our DP, and Skip, our editor, and the sound team found the perfect buzz for it.  For that matter, I think we needed to build that sign so that we could adjust it to camera.  Anyway, I could be more exhaustive, but my point is just: where is the intent?  Whose intent?  It&#x27;s such a synthesis of different arts and artistic visions, so it gets slippery to ask &quot;who made this? And what did they have in mind?&quot;</div>

It&#x27;s been the justification for so much bad behavior in the business, essentially letting those dubbed &quot;geniuses&quot; off the hook because they&#x27;re justified by their genius.  But I&#x27;m digressing.  Back to the final season: all I can say is, I hope that our team brings the story to a close in a way that&#x27;s satisfying.  I think there are a lot of narrative lines that we&#x27;ve been drawing that will become much clearer once everything is out there.  In a lot of ways, season six is the wildest one we&#x27;ve done, so I&#x27;ll be interested to hear how it works for you.  Hopefully it does!</div>

One thing I keep thinking about endings is one of Nietszche&#x27;s aphorisms—and I&#x27;m paraphrasing here—that the purpose of a melody is not its ending, and yet if a melody has not reached its end, then its meaning can&#x27;t be seen.

              <div class="line">Oh my god, the meaning question! I have always been thinking that if it’s possible to sum up the essence of a piece of art by spelling out its meaning – that the art has failed then. Why bother with the complications of verse or the subtlety of the brush strokes if it all can be said in mere prose? I have thirty-year old notes for an essay I wanted to write about this and I had a title for it: Theorie der Lyrik. So, let me just say, for now, that I am not falling into your trap.</div>

We can interpret a scene by delving into the micro-motives of a character or the allusions implied by some scenery or prop but never can interpretation be a substitute for the work itself – its final meaning will always be between its creator or, in the case of TV, its creators and the singular viewer.</div>

              <div class="line">You can always out-math me, Steffen!  But if I understand the gist of what you&#x27;re saying, it&#x27;s that there&#x27;s a tension between the Ending, with a capital E, and all the smaller endings that lead up to it, all the pieces of endings that make up the final end.</div>

              <div class="who" aria-hidden="true">SH</div>
              <div class="line">That’s nicely put. But to be more precise, what strikes me is the question of what different types of unresolved questions might exist that can persist after an ending.  A cliffhanger is not an ending. But why? Because either something fundamental about the fate of a character or the mechanics of a plot remain unresolved. This is sort of obvious but leads analytically to the question what “fundamental” means for the fate of characters or the mechanics of a plot</div>

              <div class="who" aria-hidden="true">GS</div>
              <div class="line">I see what you&#x27;re saying.  I would say that for us, we had a series of endings in our final season.  In fact, we just kept on ending.  Our first victim was Nacho, whose story found its end in episode 603.  Then Howard Hamlin found his ending, then Lalo.  And all of those were fatalities.  But then, before any more death could come along, we essentially ended the main body of our story in episode 609 with the end of Jimmy and Kim&#x27;s relationship.</div>

              <div class="line">But you could consider the death of their relationship a fatality as well</div>

              <div class="line">Very true!  It&#x27;s a character, and its end is truly the death knell for Jimmy McGill.  There&#x27;s only the shell of Saul left.</div>

            <div class="turn speaker-sh">
              <div class="who" aria-hidden="true">SH</div>
              <div class="line">But I would say that all of those endings reveal an important truth, either about the nature or future of a character or about the how, who, why, or when.</div>
            </div>
            

            <div class="turn speaker-gs">
              <div class="who" aria-hidden="true">GS</div>
              <div class="line">Yes.  Even if there&#x27;s a residue left, an uncertainty, there&#x27;s a truth.  And in the final moments, hopefully there&#x27;s another truth revealed about Jimmy and Kim and what their relationship meant.</div>

            <div class="turn speaker-sh">
              <div class="who" aria-hidden="true">SH</div>
              <div class="line">I agree and I might offer this proposition: endings that leave questions open to the how, who, why and, when can only be satisfying if they leave no ambiguity with regards to the fate of the central characters. Also, the space of possibilities regarding can’t be too large. I would say if there are more than two or perhaps three possibilities it’s no fun.</div>

              <div class="who" aria-hidden="true">GS</div>
              <div class="line">Oh no! Would that mean we left too much ambiguity for satisfaction?  Are you really now re-iterating your advocacy for satisfying endings requiring a Liebestod or at least some form of death?  There aren&#x27;t any more questions open then …</div>

            <div class="turn speaker-sh">
              <div class="who" aria-hidden="true">SH</div>
              <div class="line">Ok, now, I have to say: touché! So, on second thought, maybe there&#x27;s a place for ambiguity going beyond my proposition. But I do worry about the viewer. It might be hard to tell whether an ending with lots ambiguity is challenging or lazy.  And clearly that is situation that the story teller might wish to avoid.</div>

              <div class="line">True. But I wonder if that&#x27;s a risk a storyteller has to take, sometimes.  Or you know, as I think about it more, I think I might offer an alternate hypothesis: an ending can have ambiguity, as long as the central characters&#x27; change has resolved.  Other givens can be in the air—will Jimmy and Kim see each other again?—but only if we understand that the change from one state to another is complete. That&#x27;s when the melody is over and you understand its meaning. Am I making any sense?</div>

              <div class="line">You are. The listener knows the next note or is fairly certain of it … So, you&#x27;re saying endings that leave open the truth about the nature or fate of a central character must be constructed in a way that allows the viewer to come to her own conclusion on what comes next, the unheard note that does resound nevertheless — on the balance of evidence …</div>

              <div class="line">Something like that, yes.  The audience can extrapolate about the ending-beyond-the-end as long as the character&#x27;s arc is pointing in a clear direction.</div>

            <div class="turn speaker-sh">
              <div class="who" aria-hidden="true">SH</div>
              <div class="line">Yes, but there must be sufficient clarity. If an ending leaves open the fate of a character the possibilities can’t be too extreme, otherwise we are in the realm of the cliffhanger, no?</div>

            <div class="turn speaker-gs">
              <div class="who" aria-hidden="true">GS</div>
              <div class="line">That&#x27;s fair and interesting to me, because a lot of our fans read the ending of Saul as a cliffhanger, or that there was ambiguity as to what the final moments between the characters meant.  Specifically, they thought there was ambiguity about how they felt about one another, and more importantly what they were going to do about it in the future, after the end point of the show.  I&#x27;m not going to correct them, but I will say that we in the writers’ room felt there was not ambiguity.</div>

              <div class="line">You know, we absolutely talked about guilt, and even more, its expiation.  I had a little note at my work station with the word &quot;atonement&quot; written on it.  Just to remind me that it&#x27;s not just punishment or guilt that mattered for our journey, but whether there was redemption.  When you&#x27;re telling certain kinds of moral stories, I think, you have to suspend certain kinds of judgement.  Are they guilty?  Are they good?  I think I&#x27;d rather think of guilt and goodness as states a character can move through, not absolutes.</div>

              <div class="line">That’s a fascinating notion. So perhaps a good ending should leave not too much room for ambiguity but can have some, and if there is a space open for the fate of the character, then keep the space of possibilities more fluid excluding that both, the best and the worst, are still permissible:  she might die or suffer; or she might survive and either thrive or get by; but we don’t want the full range from dying to thriving.</div>

              <div class="line">Very good point, one dramatized quite distinctly by shows that get canceled and leave the story open.  They&#x27;ve stopped, but it&#x27;s hard to say they&#x27;ve ended, per se.</div>

              <div class="who" aria-hidden="true">SH</div>
              <div class="line">Being a mere viewer I have often wondered about that. Wouldn’t you always want to construct  the end of your current season such that it could stand as one with a proper ending if the show was cancelled? Of course, for you guys that was probably never a real issue as the show was so successful such that you always knew that you could dictate its future. But, in particular, for first seasons where the economics of it all remains unclear until after the airing of the final episode that question must be on the story-tellers’ mind</div>
            </div>
            

            <div class="turn speaker-gs">
              <div class="who" aria-hidden="true">GS</div>
              <div class="line">You&#x27;re right, we were in a privileged position to figure out when and how to end the series.  The trick of it is, let&#x27;s say you wrap up your show pretty well at the end of a season—you leave the minimum amount of dangling threads.  Now it&#x27;s easy for the studio/network to cancel you.  Why not?  No one will mind—you&#x27;ve wrapped up the story!  I think the balance is to make an end of a season that brings to a conclusion some part of the plot but not the story.  In season 4, for example, the death of Werner Ziegler wraps up a big piece of the plot, but it doesn&#x27;t end Lalo&#x27;s quest to get at Gus.  So there&#x27;s a conclusion, but it resolves only a part.  I think of course of the end of a movement in a concerto.  Or for that matter, the end of a song on an album (if the album is the kind that has a consistency, like OK Computer or The Black Parade).  There&#x27;s no good way to get canceled, though.  Your creative control goes away.</div>

              <div class="line">What about if a show gets canceled mid-season?  Couldn&#x27;t it be a blessing in disguise? Studio 60 comes to mind. Otherwise, if you are not Vince Gilligan, you have to seek season endings that could be sort-of real endings …</div>

You can let all the threads dangle.  You don&#x27;t need to chase phantom endings.  To me it feels like the difference between being shot in the face and shot from behind.</div>

              <div class="line">Now I get it. I often thought about this myself, I mean, for me, personally, and I tended to think let’s be shot from behind. But a few months ago a friend of mine was arguing differently. He said, you want to know that it’s happening and you want to experience it. Because that singular experience will be the biggest and most profound in all your life. But we shouldn’t get sidetracked. So, let’s go back to the difference between a stopping and an ending. On the surface of it, stopping and ending appear almost synonymous but I guess everybody would feel that they differ in terms of an audience&#x27;s beliefs about what might come next—with endings generating a subset of the future possibilities that arise after a mere stopping.</div>
            </div>
            

            <div class="turn speaker-gs">
              <div class="who" aria-hidden="true">GS</div>
              <div class="line">That sounds good on the surface. But I think that a good ending, paradoxically, generates more possibilities.  It evokes an &quot;after,&quot; in a way that stopping simply doesn&#x27;t.</div>
            </div>
            

            <div class="turn speaker-sh">
              <div class="who" aria-hidden="true">SH</div>
              <div class="line">I have to think about that. So, you are saying that a stopping means that it’s easy for the viewer to tell what’s next because it’s somehow trivial while an ending implies that the viewer has keep thinking?</div>
            </div>
            

            <div class="turn speaker-gs">
              <div class="who" aria-hidden="true">GS</div>
              <div class="line">Not really. if you stop, then there are, in effect, infinite potential endings that will never come to be.  So it&#x27;s either too simple or it&#x27;s too complex to be satisfying if you just stop.There is not much point in thinking about the possibilities and it that sense there just aren’t any. With an ending that’s different. It shows you how to extrapolate. So, yes, there are fewer possibilities but more possibilities that can be examined, that are worth your thoughts.</div>

In a way, the cliffhanger is pretty binary—and therefore there&#x27;s not much to think about.  The hero falls from the cliff or she doesn’t. That’s fifty-fifty, the toss of a coin. Again, not much to think about.</div>

              <div class="line">I like that. With a Wagnerian ending there is nothing to think about, we can just revel in its beauty. But we don’t have to engage in reasoning. No cognition required. And the same if there is too much ambiguity, a stopping or a cliffhanger, in either case it’s not worth to imagine the future. It’s just too uncertain or, as you say, a trivial coin toss. Thanks. I’m getting it now. There are more possibilities to think about with non-Wagnerian but yet proper endings …</div>

Are you saying that the ambiguity left about the future, about the story after its told end, must rest in the characters’ free will? His preferences and abilities to make a conscious choice?</div>

              <div class="line">I wasn&#x27;t thinking about it in those terms, but yes, I see what you&#x27;re saying.  Maybe that&#x27;s one reason to really emphasize the clarity of a character’s arc. If the change is not complete, there will be too much uncertainty about what a character wants, his or her internal makeup. But if the arc points in a clear direction, the viewer has all the ingredients that are necessary to picture plausible futures. Schrödinger’s cat simply can’t live in that state forever.</div>

              <div class="line">The poor cat. Eventually it will be dead!  So, let me try to summarize. You are essentially saying that satisfying endings are either Wagnerian or involve a clear sense of the main characters’ free will by which they will make the next important choices but that, at the same time, we have learned enough about the characters’ mental and moral changes to be able to predict what will happen next with some sufficient certainty?</div>

              <div class="line">That&#x27;s an interesting formulation!  It has a good German precision to it. But, yes, there has to be some sense of what the characters will do next, predicted by the arc of change</div>

              <div class="line">Yes.  And now I feel like you&#x27;re inventing the calculus of character.  The area under the curve for the function of the character... But if it&#x27;s done right, it should be simple.  Or it should feel simple to the audience.  They don&#x27;t want to see the mechanism.  If they glimpse the machinery, fine, but if it&#x27;s just clanking away, the whole thing feels... rote, dead.  Mechanical.  The viewer has to understand the characters’ development. She has to empathize with them such that she feels confident in her understanding of what drives them at the end.  But not consciously.  She should feel it more than understand it.  The change from one state to another in the character should resonate with her.</div>

            <div class="turn speaker-sh">
              <div class="who" aria-hidden="true">SH</div>
              <div class="line">That’s an important qualification to my earlier summary stressing the cognitive side. Essentially it looks like you are saying that the understanding must be driven by empathy. Which, of course, makes your non-Wagnerian ending ever so slightly more Wagnerian.</div>
